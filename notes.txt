links components are preloaded when it visible to the browser's viewport

multiple fetching on a single page is actually a bad idea example promise[getUser(), getUserStuff()]
always choose data streaming instead (loading.tsx or suspense)
tip: when using suspense over and over again in the same page. use the key prop, so react knows we suspense differently

when using state hooks, think first if searchParams is applicable. one advtgs:
- search paramso object is accesible trough server components
- sharable links and good for SEO

router.push vs router.replace:
push: traditional a tag that just pushes the browser's history stack
replace: replaces the browser's history stack (walang madadagdag) use this when
  - the page might break when navigating back
  - search queries
  - when you are linking to the same page (eg. /dashboard will route to /dashboard)

When to use the useSearchParams() hook vs. the searchParams prop?
As a general rule, if you want to read the params from the client, use the useSearchParams() hook as this avoids having to go back to the server.


gets kona, by default naka cache yung fetch() mo, kaya pag nag npm run build ka, circle yung icon meaning its static
pero kapag nag lagay ka ng cache no-store, magiging serverside rendering naman sya pag nag npm run build ka
